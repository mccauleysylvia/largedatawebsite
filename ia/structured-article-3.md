## Uses for Aloe Vera
- Slice aloe leaves lengthwise and use the inner sides as a biodegradable body scrub in the shower.
- Treat burns from minor mishaps in the kitchen — from grease splatters or hot utensils — with a mix of aloe gel and vitamin E oil.
- Soothe and heal sunburns. Aloe contains cooling properties similar to menthol.
- Take the sting or itch out of insect bites.
- For soft feet make an exfoliating foot mask by mixing together a half cup of oatmeal, a half cup of corn meal, four tbsp. of aloe vera gel and a half cup of unscented body lotion.
- Swab over blisters for quick relief.
- Replace creams and lotions as a general moisturizer for dry skin. Aloe is fast absorbing!
- Reverse signs of aging skin and wrinkles. Cleopatra did!
- Make skin new again with an exfoliating, organic sugar scrub by mixing together 2 tbsp. of aloe vera, 2 tbsp. of organic brown sugar and 1 tsp. of organic lemon juice.
- For rougher patches of skin, mix together an organic salt scrub using two cups of sea salt, one cup of aloe vera, one cup of organic coconut oil and two tbsp. of local, organic honey.
- Boil leaves in a pan of water and breathe in the vapor to alleviate asthma.
