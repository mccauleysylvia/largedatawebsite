## Observations

- Did the participants have any common comments?
	- Both participants found it difficult to sort my cards and took awhile.
- Did they have questions that stood out?
	- No, neither paricipant had any questions. 
- Did they struggle with certain articles or topics?
	- They struggled with certain topics because they had no context for different categories. They found it difficult to sort items or concepts they hadn't heard of.
- Did they find common groupings? Or were the groupings completely different?
	- They both had a "dangers" category, and sorted similar cards into there. They both created a homemade category and similar cards were sorted into there. 
- Were some of the groupings completely unexpected?
	- I did not expect the "no shampoo" category to fall into a dangers category, because it is one of the positive categories. This reminds me that without context a user doesn't know how to organize the information, I suppose. I also didn't expect "dealing with dandruff naturally" to be sorted into the dangers category.
- Were the results similar to your expectations?
	- I didn't really have any expectations, but the results were completely different than how I originally planned on sorting my information. 
- How did you feel while watching them perform the task?
	- Frustrated and intruiged. Frustrated because I already thought I had figured out the best way to sort the information, but intruiged that they had thought of completely different way. 
- Were some of the groupings completely unexpected?
	- I did not expect the "no shampoo" category to fall into a dangers category, because it is one of the positive categories. This reminds me that without context a user doesn't know how to organize the information, I suppose. I also didn't expect "dealing with dandruff naturally" to be sorted into the dangers category.
- The verdict
	- This excercise really made me realize that if my information can't be sorted by the users, they would have a difficult time understanding it on a website. This excercise convinced me to re-think the content that I was using, and I've sinced simplified it. I've combined my previous sorting method with the ones my participants created to make a system that makes much more sense for the user.
