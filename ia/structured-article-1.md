## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup (55 g) baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)
- 1/4 cup (32 g) cornstarch
- 10 drops tea tree oil
- 2+ tbsp (30 g) coconut oil, melted

## Instructions
1. Combine the baking soda, cornstarch and tea tree oil in a bowl.
	- Mix well using a whisk or fork.  
2. Add the coconut oil.
	- Stir until the mixture is smooth. If you are adding optional skin soothers like Vitamin E or sweet almond oil, add it during this step. 
3. Press the mixture into the deodorant stick container.
	- Make sure the base is twisted all the way down to the bottom. It may seem soft at first, but should set up after a few days. 
4. (Optional) Adding fragrance. You can easily vary the fragrance of your deodorant by using different essential oils in place of the tea tree oil.
	- Lavender, rose, eucalyptus or sandalwood are good choices because they share the anti-bacterial properties of tea tree oil.
	- Chamomile, a known skin soother, would also work well.
	- Start with just a few drops. Add a little more at a time until your deodorant has the scent you want.
5. Use your deodorant. Apply this deodorant in the same manner you would the store-bought kind. A little goes a long way, so use a lighter hand than you usually would.
