#Style Report
I have 3 different possible styles for my website on Natural Skincare. The main purpose of the website is to provide recipes on how to make your own skincare products.

## Style 1:

###Pros
This style takes the word natural literally. It is very green and feels very organic and healthy. The colours are generic enough appeal to both of my personas (a middle aged woman and young man). 

###Cons
It is an obvious and generic style for the theme. It doesn't feel very friendly or people-oriented. It seems more like a commercial website for a specific product. It might be overusing the green theme.

## Style 2:

###Pros
This style still feels natural but in a more woodsy/forest way. It is much warmer and more welcoming than style #1.  It is colourful but not too bright or flashy, so it would appeal to either of my personas. It is versatile but not boring.

###Cons
The style might be too trendy.

##Style 3

###Pros
This style is very fresh and bright and would appeal to me as a user. It keeps your attention. It has a very DIY blog feel, and works for my female persona. Despite all the colours it still feels very clean and simple.

###Cons
It would probably alienate my male persona; the bright, flashy colours might not appeal to him. I'm not sure it has the right vibe for the purpose of my website; it could be mistaken for a craft/decorating blog.
